                        <p>In November 2022, Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, began a <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230627113149/https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1589541705921212416">tweet
                                thread</a> with “I’ve heard you loud and clear” in response to a <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221226053751/https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-cleaning-fees-added-total-price-search-results-after-complaints-2022-11">customer
                                backlash</a> over the way they hid additional costs till the checkout page. “You feel
                            like prices aren’t transparent…starting next month, you’ll be able to see the total price
                            you’re paying up front” he said about a change that could be made urgently in a day, or
                            carefully over a few.</p>



                        <p>When he said <em>I’ve heard you loud and clear</em> he was also telling his User Experience
                            (<abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>) researchers and designers they were ignored, <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230417010101/https://airbnb.design/a-quick-update/">if
                                they were heard at all</a>. The <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark pattern</a> was no mistake.
                            Intentionally designed to deceive and benefit from excited holiday planners and their
                            potential to give in to the sunk cost fallacy. Instead of addressing the ridiculous
                            additional fees the company chose to trick customers into paying them. That’s not empathy,
                            at best it’s apathy, at worst it’s hate. The decision to fix it only came after the balance
                            of business value and public relations started to tip the wrong way. Chesky presented
                            himself as a model CEO doing right by his customers as if he wasn’t responsible for wronging
                            them in the first place. People <a

                            He demonstrated how bright a performative aura of care can shine to hide questions about the
                            business activity or even questions about the business’s legitimacy to exist.
                        </p>



                        <p>In April of 2022 Twitter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Image_sharing">added
                                the option</a> to write short descriptions of the images you attach to a tweet. Those
                            descriptions help vision-impaired people that rely on synthesised voice software to read out
                            the contents of a page. The thing about image descriptions is that the World Wide Web
                            Consortium’s (<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>) <a
                                href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">standards for <abbr
                                    title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></a>—the document structure language of
                            the web (and Twitter)—has <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute#History"><em>required</em> them since
                                1999</a>. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#History">Twitter went
                                live</a>, that requirement was already seven years old and twenty three years old by the
                            time they obeyed it completely. To praise Twitter for recognition of vision-impaired people
                            is like praising a heavy drinker for taking a hip flask to their kid’s school play instead
                            of skipping out to the pub. They did the bare minimum, reluctantly, despite having <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> researchers and designers on deck. For this they
                            deserve no more than a collective <em>why the fuck did it take so long?</em></p>



                        <p>Goodness in a product’s design tends to make more sense as a convenient side-effect of a
                            business case. For Twitter, crowd sourced image descriptions written for free can make a
                            nice data set to sell for machine learning.</p>



                        <p>If we look at industry-wide examples we can see how intrinsic care replaced with business
                            incentives leads to low quality black-and-white photocopies of the original ideas.
                            Everything becomes optimised to meet business requirements and any surviving sense of care
                            that remains is there by chance.</p>



                        <p>Since the beginning of the web, writing <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
                            compliant <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has been highly regarded among
                            developers. Standards compliant code makes the web accessible but the design philosophy of
                            prioritising accessibility also led to the unique quality of <abbr
                                title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> being forgiving if the standards are
                            ignored. Showing <em>something</em> in a web browser is more accessible than showing
                            <em>nothing</em>, so a web page will still look right if the code is not perfect. In the
                            early days, this meant that the quality of the <abbr
                                title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> wasn’t factored into timelines and budgets
                            because it was extra work that didn’t change how the site looked. If a site was built with
                            standards compliant code it was because the developers wanted it that way and did it on
                            their own time.
                        </p>



                        <p>That all changed in the early 2000s when <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Search Engine
                                Optimisation</a> (<abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>) arrived. The
                            techniques for improving the visibility of a site in Google’s search results included rules
                            for the structure of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. These rules
                            took some <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards and tied them to a
                            tangible business case of heightened search visibility. I remember the surreal experience of
                            an <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> consultant presenting these rules to
                            my web development team. We already knew everything they said because we understood web
                            accessibility, but they were retelling these things as novel techniques for getting more
                            sales leads from search.</p>



                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a>
                            (<abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr>)—a design philosophy for building sites that
                            work for everyone regardless of the device they use or their connection speed—gained
                            commercial adoption in a similar way, well after developers and designers had already seen
                            its value as an empathetic design philosophy. <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210219203121/https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update">Google
                                announced that &#8220;mobile-friendly&#8221; sites would be preferred in search
                                results</a> and some, not all, <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> techniques
                            became convenient. Now responsiveness in commercial web apps focuses mostly on being
                            visually accessible to devices used by a target demographic. Anything outside is considered
                            an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case">edge case</a> and ignored, or again,
                            supported by developers and designers taking initiative in their own time. That’s why some
                            sites will crash the browser on your parents iPad, use up your mobile data before anything
                            renders, and fail basic accessibility tests. Browsing the web has become a reason in itself
                            to upgrade a device.</p>



                        <p>And yet… <em>User Experience</em> has become part of the everyday lexicon. Normal people who
                            don’t make tech products say they prefer a product “for the <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr>”. Normal people who do make tech products say their
                            product “has great <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>”. It’s generally accepted as a
                            measure of how easy something is to use, how little it gets in the way. Like <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability">usability</a> before, it takes something
                            that was a core concern of commercial product design—since companies sold products—and
                            treats it like some novel modern add-on. But the real innovation is making it seem like the
                            ease of use, the user experience, is the <em>only thing that matters</em>, because sometimes
                            a product doesn’t offer much else.</p>



                        <p><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> is a popular cloud-based product that is marketed
                            with no purpose more specific than <em>productivity</em> or <em>collaboration</em>. It takes
                            existing products like wikis, project management tools, and document editors and mashes them
                            together into one window. Notion is the sum of products that were already legitimised as
                            being useful by themselves. Despite inheriting all of its usefulness from other useful
                            things, Notion’s success is the result of good usability design that makes it easy to use
                            those things in one place. For Notion the <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> is the
                            product.</p>



                        <p><em>Productivity</em> and <em>collaboration</em> might seem like vague purposes to an
                            individual but to a tech company they are compelling, concrete, purposes. Businesses are
                            sold corporate subscription plans for Notion and other products, like <a
                                href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and even <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>,
                            which are imposed on staff as essential tools. For employees these products are universal
                            tools of nothing in particular. Each <em>collaboration</em> feature makes the anxiety of
                            <em>productivity</em> ubiquitous. Little floating heads always watching over the document
                            you’re working on, a perfect simulation of what we used to call <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement">micromanagement</a>. They are
                            virtual open-plan offices where everything you create becomes littered with comments and
                            conversations you didn’t ask for.
                        </p>



                        <p>The thing they all have in common is how strikingly easy they are to use. Part of which comes
                            from very good usability design and part of which comes from the fact that you use them for
                            a purpose you define yourself. When they say it’s for <em>productivity</em> instead of
                            <em>doing your taxes</em>, they are benefiting from such an abstract criteria for failure
                            that it doesn’t really mean anything. If you want to use it to do your taxes you can go
                            ahead. But if it can’t help with some obscure tax calculation, you’re an edge case. For a
                            <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designer at Notion the concern is that it can be
                            used easily, not how well it does a specific task for a specific expertise.
                        </p>



                        <p>And, look, I know how obvious and easy it is to dismiss this as <em>how capitalism
                                works</em>. The problem being the aura of care surrounding <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> pretends that capitalism can be coaxed into giving a
                            shit. It chugs along as if <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designers and researchers
                            are the ones who are going to cause a revolution of socialist CEOs who consider users beyond
                            their money and their data. But the inside secret of commercial <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> is that the empathy is just a posture and the
                            businesses benefit from the aura of care without having to entertain it. In non-profit,
                            government, or volunteer-based open source projects, the posture can, and usually does,
                            match the reality but in commercial tech it’s always contingent to the strength of a
                            business case. The Google <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design course that says it
                            will help you &#8220;<a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230525092144/https://grow.google/intl/ALL_ca/certificates/ux-design/">empathise

                            a future of despair.</p>



                        <p>That’s why <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> can help legitimise products that are
                            intrinsically bad for people who use them. Tell someone that cigarettes are <em>easy to
                                use</em> and they’ll ask about the reasons for using them, but tell them about the
                            <em>user experience</em> of cigarettes and they’ll ask what makes the experience good.
                        </p>



                        <p>Search Twitter for “FTX <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>” and you’ll find no shortage
                            of <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230627115749/https://twitter.com/chezgregg/status/1664095660201869313">&#8220;it

                            well after the fraud was exposed. It doesn’t matter which fraud or how obvious the scam was
                            beforehand, the same search will yield the same results. The <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> aura of care shines brighter.</p>



                        <p>The posture is strengthened by a <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> community that seems
                            open in its contradictions. The discipline is detached from the substance of the underlying
                            products it is applied to so empathy for users is mixed in with discourse of psychological
                            exploits for increasing user engagement. There are <a

                            <em>use psychology to design better products &amp; services</em> and at the top of most
                            <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> book lists you’ll find <a
                                href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked">Nir Eyal’s Hooked</a> to
                            learn <em>how to build habit forming products</em>. Nir says he wants to see people hooked
                            on products that promote healthy habits, but of course the ones getting rich from a product
                            are going to believe their own bullshit when they say it’s harmless, healthy, or going to
                            save the world. Another seminal <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> book is <a
                                href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259070.Don_t_Make_Me_Think_">Steve Krug’s
                                Don’t Make Me Think</a> which has popularised the relentless removal of
                            &#8220;friction&#8221; from user interfaces for over two decades. When you’re trading crypto
                            with your life savings you <em>do want to think</em> about every thing you do despite how
                            much the product will be designed to avoid it.
                        </p>



                        <p>Marketing is about attracting new customers and retaining existing ones and commercial <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> is concerned with removing the barriers that prevent
                            these. <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> is powerful because it doesn’t seem like
                            marketing and the practitioners don’t see themselves as being in the marketing business.</p>



                        <p>Like the sales tough guy that demonstrates his versatility by saying he can <em>sell you this
                                fucking pen</em>. <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> doesn’t care what you hit with
                            the baseball bat, it just makes sure you don’t get splinters from it. Web3, <abbr
                                title="Non-Fungible Token">NFT</abbr>s, and blockchain products need this product
                            agnostic approach that keeps everything in the realm of experience because blurry,
                            uncertain, or non-existent usefulness is a form of friction itself. Consider FTX and all the
                            other centralised crypto exchange, trading, and lending platforms that turned out to be
                            massive scams. Centralised crypto products come from a community-wide <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> need to obscure necessary complexity rather than
                            create usefulness that is concrete enough to justify it. Complexity justified by usefulness
                            is obvious in products like <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> where a
                            terrifying interface hasn’t stopped it from becoming an industry standard. The evidence that
                            gaining the expertise to use it will pay off is overwhelming.</p>



                        <p>There is no wonder that crypto, metaverse, and now AI pushers, are obsessed with <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr>. They talk about the user experience as a final
                            barrier to adoption as if people are clambering behind a reinforced wall for a prize they
                            can see and know they need. <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> ignores questionable
                            usefulness and the bright aura of care distracts from real questions of ethics and harm. It
                            hides the real intentions of the business, not just behind a posture, but behind <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> professionals who have a genuine sense of care. <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> researchers and designers talk about empathy because
                            they <em>are</em> empathetic people. In a commercial context there is tension between that
                            empathy and viable business activity so the role becomes usability design by another name.
                        </p>



                        <p><abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> seniors working outside commercial constraints don’t
                            help the situation. They push the <em>fight for the user</em> rhetoric in Medium articles,
                            tweets, and LinkedIn posts. They goad young <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> starters
                            to push for empathetic values without acknowledging how few contexts they are compatible
                            with. For most, choosing where you work is a luxury. It’s going to be the commercial <abbr
                                title="User Experience">UX</abbr> roles that pay the best every time. Designing socially
                            beneficial products is something to strive for, but not something that should weigh on the
                            shoulders of a junior <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designer while their manager
                            is asking them to draw a dark pattern in Figma.</p>



                        <p><abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> needs to make clear distinctions between commercial
                            design work and design as a social good so the aura of care is not just an aura. Until that
                            happens we’ll continue to see the worst companies hire the best people to help them make the
                            worst things.</p>
