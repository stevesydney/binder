                            <p>Boom! After a year of warning them repeatedly, the SEC has finally taken action against
                                Coinbase, the biggest US crypto exchange, for operating as an illegal securities
                                exchange and selling unregistered securities. [<a

                                SEC filed a suit against the Binance exchange — which we’ll be covering next time — the

                            <p>SEC wants Coinbase to be enjoined from doing any of this again, pay disgorgement and
                                interest, pay a civil money penalty, and pay “equitable relief” to investors.</p>
                            <p>There are no surprises in the charges —&nbsp;and unlike the Binance lawsuit, no claims of
                                fraud. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was also not named in the complaint, unlike the
                                Binance complaint where founder CZ was named.</p>
                            <p>The complaint outlines how Coinbase executives understood the laws governing the market
                                and sale of securities in the US, even as they failed to abide by those laws.</p>
                            <p>None of this should come as a surprise. The SEC <a

                                    report in July 2017</a>.</p>
                            <p>Even a year before the DAO Report, Coinbase demonstrated it understood the <a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.">Howey test</a> when it
                                began assessing tokens before listing them:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>In or around December 2016, Coinbase released on its website a document entitled, “A
                                    Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens.”&nbsp; This document included a
                                    section on “How to determine if a token is a security,” and explained: “The US
                                    Supreme Court case of SEC v Howey established the test for whether an arrangement
                                    involves an investment contract. An investment contract is a type of security.” This
                                    “Framework” acknowledged that “[f]or many blockchain tokens, the first two elements
                                    of the Howey test” — i.e., investment of money and common enterprise — “are likely
                                    to be met.”</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Starting in 2019, Coinbase relied on its “Crypto Rating Council” (CRC) to determine if an
                                asset was a security.</p>
                            <p>It turns out Coinbase offered some tokens even <i>after</i> their own internal report
                                said they were very likely securities:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Meanwhile, between late 2019 and the end of 2020, Coinbase more than doubled the
                                    number of crypto assets available for trading on the Coinbase Platform, and it more
                                    than doubled that number again in 2021.&nbsp; During this period, Coinbase made
                                    available on the Coinbase Platform crypto assets with high “risk” scores under the
                                    CRC framework it had adopted. In other words, to realize exponential growth of the
                                    Coinbase Platform and boost its own trading profits, Coinbase made the strategic
                                    business decision to add crypto assets to the Coinbase Platform even where it
                                    recognized the crypto assets had the characteristics of securities.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Coinbase also contacted some token promoters to suggest they use less security-like
                                phrasing in their documents — as if the SEC cares what you call your thing, and not how
                                it works.</p>
                            <p>The complaint names 13 tokens on Coinbase as securities — Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA),
                                MATIC, Filecoin (FIL), Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Dapper Labs
                                FLOW, ICP, NEAR, Voyager Token (VGX), DASH, and Nexo’s in-house token NEXO.</p>
                            <p>(Oh no, not Axie infinity! That was our <a
                                    href="https://amycastor.com/2022/05/23/kara-swisher-promotes-cryptos-for-your-retirement-compares-it-to-early-internet/">retirement!</a>)
                            </p>
                            <p>NEXO was not actually on the Coinbase Platform, only in the Coinbase Wallet, which trades
                                via DEXes — but the SEC is still going after Coinbase as offering NEXO for trading. The
                                first DEX the SEC busted was <a
                                    href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2018/11/08/news-sec-busts-etherdelta-swift-not-using-ripplenet-another-galts-gulch-scam-craig-wright-claims-to-be-satoshi-again/">EtherDelta
                                    in November 2018</a>, so it absolutely considers activity on DEXes within its ambit.
                            </p>
                            <p>The complaint goes through each of the 13 tokens and spells out precisely why each
                                qualifies as a security according to the Howey test.</p>
                            <p>The SEC notes that for <a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934">Exchange
                                    Act</a> purposes, it only needs to show that <i>one</i> of these tokens is a
                                security. But it’ll show its working on all thirteen, just to bludgeon the point home.
                            </p>
                            <p>In three cases — SOL, FIL, and FLOW — the tokens literally <i>filed with the SEC</i> as
                                offerings of securities, but ones exempt from registration. So Coinbase may have some
                                trouble now claiming those tokens aren’t any sort of security.</p>
                            <p>The SEC notes that it outlined why AMP, DerivaDAO (DDX), LCX, Omegle (OMG), Powerledger
                                (POWR), Rally (RLY), and XYO were securities in previous actions. All of these tokens
                                are or were listed on Coinbase.</p>
                            <p>Because Coinbase listed those tokens on its platform, which the SEC says are securities,
                                Coinbase was required to register as an exchange, brokerage, and clearing agency — all
                                businesses it was clearly operating — but just didn’t.</p>
                            <h3>A stake through your heart</h3>
                            <p>Staking as a service is incredibly obviously an investment contract — a security
                                offering. In 2019, <a

                                    SEC started looking into this.</a></p>
                            <p>The SEC worked with 10 state securities regulators who have said that Coinbase’s staking
                                product is an unregistered security.</p>
                            <p>An unsettled SEC case can take months to go through — but several state regulators have
                                issued immediate cease and desist orders. [<i>Alabama </i><a

                            </p>
                            <p>Alabama, Illinois, Vermont, and Washington are giving Coinbase a month to respond.
                                California, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have told
                                Coinbase to cease and desist offering staking in their states immediately.</p>
                            <p>Most states are also fining Coinbase per violation — that is, per investor.</p>
                            <h3>But the SEC allowed Coinbase to go public!</h3>
                            <p>Crypto fans have been crying&nbsp; how unfair it is that the SEC is filing an action
                                against Coinbase when they approved the S-1 for Coinbase’s public listing! The legal
                                theory that Coinbase and its chief legal officer Paul Grewal are pushing is that
                                approving the listing meant the SEC approved of Coinbase’s business.</p>
                            <p>This theory is obviously inane. That Coinbase seems to be leaning hard on this theory
                                looks like desperation — that this is really the best they’ve got.</p>
                            <p>The SEC had warned Coinbase that approval of the registration statement did not mean the
                                agency had approved the underlying business activity. The SEC says in the complaint:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Declaring effective a Form S-1 registration statement does not constitute an SEC or
                                    staff opinion on, or endorsement of, the legality of an issuer’s underlying
                                    business.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>The SEC also points out that since going public in 2021, Coinbase has acknowledged in its
                                S-1 and in subsequent filings the risk that cryptos it lists could be deemed securities.
                            </p>
                            <p>According to the SEC:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Coinbase has elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’
                                    interests, and over compliance with the law and the regulatory framework that
                                    governs the securities markets and was created to protect investors and the U.S.
                                    capital markets.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Coinbase remains extremely good friends with its early investor Andreessen Horowitz and
                                still has two directors (Marc Andreessen and Katie Haun) from a16z on its board.
                                Coinbase was also the exchange of choice for a16z Crypto to cash out their <a

                            <h3>The searing light of regulatory clarity</h3>
                            <p>This is the beginning of the end for crypto in the US.</p>
                            <p>Every crypto exchange in the US has been operating illegally, and it was only a matter of
                                time before the SEC would start shutting them down. They knew it was coming. <a

                                into distressed territory. [<a

                            <p>Grewal tells Bloomberg he’ll take the SEC fight to the Supreme Court if he has to! Of
                                course, he would say that. As with the SEC suit against Ripple, this suit is existential
                                for Coinbase. [<a

                            <p>Coinbase’s strategy all along has been to avoid regulation and hope it could lobby
                                Congress to make special rules for it.</p>
                            <p>The new bill on crypto markets that House Republicans hope to put through would make it
                                easier for exchanges like Coinbase to trade tokens that would previously have been
                                unregistered penny stocks at best. [<a

                            <p>They might be lucky? But crypto equals fraud in the minds of the public these days, and
                                hence in the minds of politicians.</p>
                            <p>In any case, Brian Armstrong of Coinbase reassures us that this complaint is <i>good</i>

                                is going a bit better than its attempts to dodge a suit. Judge Cheryl Ann Krause of the
                                Third Circuit Court of Appeals has told the SEC to answer within seven days whether it’s

                                to decide, and to give status reports on how the work is going. [<a
